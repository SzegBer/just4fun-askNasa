NASA - Astronomy Picture of the Day - API

Task was to make an API work on our website and make some dynamic data change in our DOM using Vanilla JavaScript logics. This school project was my first introduction to HTTP requests. It contains a few basic level UX element such as a calendar and an image gallery.

Next on my ToDoList regarding this project:
- Recreate the full website using React.
I value this code / project as my very first introduction to fetch, therefore I love the idea to keep it as it is, to be able to look back at it and see how much I have learned since.
