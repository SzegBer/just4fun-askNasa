NASA - Astronomy Picture of the Day - API

Task was to make an API work on our website and make some dynamic data change in our DOM.

- The project uses the public NASA API to display the picture of the day.
- There is a calendar where you can chose the date you are interested in
- There is a gallery, where you can browse images in a weekly layout
- There are some next/prev buttons displayed as well to help browsing.

Next on my ToDoList regarding this project:
- tidy up the unnecessary duplicated codes in JavaScript, and display everything on a single html document.

Meanwhile I value this project as my very first introduction to fetch, therefore I love the idea to keep it as it is, to be able to look back at it and see how much I have learned since.
